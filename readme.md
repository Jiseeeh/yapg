# Yet Another Platformer Game (YAPG)

A simple platformer game made by me and my friend, @LueKely. Most of the assets came from [here](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1) and some like the sfx came from [here](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets). @LueKely just modified some of them and also added his own sprites, like the button.
